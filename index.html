          Domesticated cats still practice things that their cousins, Tigers, with whom they share 95.6% of their DNA, do in the wild. As a result:

          Cats bury their feces because in the wild, they can tell each other’s feces apart. It’s a natural response as they are ambush predators and don’t want other animals or larger predators to be able to track their scent easily.
        </li>

        <li>
          Cats sleep about 70% of their life, compared to humans who sleep about 30–40%. Cats are apex predators, and predators sleep to conserve their energy in the wild.
        </li>

        <li>
          Over time cats have evolved to learn that stagnant water sources are more likely to make them sick, and as a result they prefer moving water sources. As such,

        </li>

        <li>
          Perpetually dehydrated cats are highly susceptible to kidney disease and urinary tract infections.
          UTIs can also make your fur baby throw up and urinate blood.
        </li>

        <li>
          Food = Love to cats. With that said, to them, when you feed them that means you love them.
        </li>

        <li>
          Cats sometimes go belly up to say hello and to signify their trust in you. If your feline friend does not like their belly rubbed but shows you their belly when they see you, it’s not because they want their belly rubbed, but rather that they trust you and are comfortable around you.
        </li>

        <li>
          Cats scratch to spread their scent and as a stress reliever.
        </li>

        <li>
          Cats also lick things as a stress reliever, which is why (I personally consider) lickable treats to be a necessary part of a cat’s diet. Lickable treats are also a wonderful way to bond with a pet.
        </li>

        <li>
          Cats like their towers and furniture moved around their living space.
        </li>

        <li>
          Adult cats require less food than kittens.
        </li>

        <li>
          Cats are highly trainable, including learning to associate words with buttons. As such, they can communicate with their humans.
        </li>

        <li>
          Unfortunately, cats cannot taste sweet things.
        </li>

        <li>
          Cats can see red, green, and blue and combinations thereof.
        </li>

        <li>
          There are around 73–80 recognized cat breeds across associations, all with their own number of “official” cat breeds.
        </li>

        <li>
          Although cats cannot understand fluent English, they still value a good conversation. As a result, they slowly learn words through associations, kind of like the talking pet buttons, just without the physical cue being a button.
        </li>

        <li>
          Cats can make up to 100 sounds, in comparison to dogs who can only make around 10.
        </li>

        <li>
          Cats meow to communicate with humans, but rarely vocalize to communicate with other cats.
        </li>

        <li>
          Male cats are more likely to be left-pawed, while females tend to be right-pawed.
        </li>

        <li>
          The vibrations from a cat purring, resonating at 20–150 Hertz, have been proven to be therapeutic. They use it to heal themselves (even to the point of helping bone regeneration), and to soothe us when we are sick or injured.
        </li>

        <li>
          Cats can recognize their owner by their voice.
        </li>

        <li>
          Cats can jump up to 6 times their length.
        </li>

        <li>
          A cat’s sense of smell is about 14 times stronger than a human’s.
        </li>

        <li>
          The average lifespan of a cat has risen from about 7 years in the early 1980s to around 15 years by 2021.
        </li>

        <li>
          Most black cats have yellow eyes.
        </li>

        <li>
          When a cat blinks at you it is their way of showing affection. Feel absolutely free to slow-blink back to reciprocate the sweet gesture.
        </li>

        <li>
          A happy cat “makes biscuits” or kneads on an object of choice, or in the air.
        </li>

        <li>
          If your feline friend is a young kitten, it is highly recommended not to use clumping litter. Kittens, like babies, learn by putting things in their mouths. Clumping litter can cause “rock-like” obstructions.
        </li>

        <li>
          A single intact female can produce up to 40,000 surviving offspring in a span of 10 years.
        </li>

        <li>
          Cats don’t rely on us for social structure. They see us as “fellow cats". For this reason they may bring you gifts, kills from around the house, or their favorite toys.

            Felines prefer drinking from moving water sources.
          </i>
          If you can afford it, investing in a water fountain can entice your kitty to drink more often, keeping them well hydrated and helping prevent kidney stones and UTIs. I noticed my kitten's water intake drastically increased after switching to an automatic water fountain.
          <a class="nav-link" href="#Amazon_Recommendations">See this section full of my Amazon recommendations</a> to get you started with some ideas.
        </p>

        <p>
          Non-porous material is the most ideal for food and water bowls; the same goes for automatic feeders and fountains. Plastic is porous and holds germs really well. This can cause chin acne in some cats. Stainless steel, Pyrex, glass, or ceramic bowls are wonderful alternatives to plastic.
        </p>

        <p>
          A food bowl or automatic feeder is essential. If feeding your kitten four times a day for about 365 days seems like a big ask, or obligations such as work and/or personal life would interfere with frequent feedings, I recommend investing in a high-quality automatic feeder. You will appreciate all of the time and energy you get back as a result.
        </p>

        <p>
          Tiki Baby or Fancy Feast kitten pâté kept my kitten happy and content.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although not completely necessary, fish oil aids in skin, fur, and brain development for a growing kitten. I notice the way my kitten’s coat shines since supplementing fish oil. He also really enjoys the taste of it.
        </p>

        <p>
          For picky eaters, nutritional yeast and meal toppers can be used as mealtime mix-ins.
          Fortified nutritional yeast is an ingredient commonly found in a lot of cat treats and sometimes food. It is a flavor enhancer that tastes somewhat cheesy. However, while tasty, it is very good for your kitten’s health. It contains B vitamins and has antifungal and antibacterial benefits which may help protect your fur baby from infections.
          Meal toppers or meal mixers are typically liquid-based and add flavor to your kitten’s food while softening it as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          I fed my kitten Purina One Plus Kitten Food, but personally would have gone with Tiki Baby if I had a choice and could do it again.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some kind of cat hideout to retreat to until they are comfortable in your space is very helpful. I personally recommend putting this “hidey hole” in the room you dedicate to them, and slowly moving it to a different area in the house. As they begin exploring your space, this will make them feel more confident because if they get spooked, they have a safe space to retreat to.
        </p>

        <p>
          A room you can dedicate to them is ideal — most people choose the bathroom; that's what I went with.
        </p>

        <p>
          A litter box:
          cats, young and old, are predisposed to using “litter-like” things. So if you find yourself out of litter after a late-night McDonald's run, something that is "litter-like" will suffice until stores can open in the morning. Plastic bins, old Amazon shipping boxes (lined, of course), etc. will work until you can find an open store.
        </p>

        <p>
          Toys and enrichment are important. I recommend getting “one of each kind” of toy in the beginning, until you find the type of toy (or toys) your kitten has an affinity for. This will save you lots of time and money, guaranteed. The easiest way to do this is buying a variety pack, and slowly introducing the toys to your kitten or new adopt. You will quickly see what they gravitate to. I have a Bombay cat, which is one of the most highly active breeds. Although he will play with almost anything, he still has a few types of toys he gravitates to.
        </p>

        <p>
          I recommend once the investment in a carrier has been made, to leave it out so your cat assumes it's a normal part of the day-to-day. Cats tend to fight getting into their carrier because it does not feel like their choice. I even went as far as to incorporate his carrier into playtime and throwing treats in it, thus creating positive associations. This made it so he would jump into his carrier on his own when it was time to go on some occasions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some cats have problems with proper hydration. This can be helped by mixing a tiny bit of water into their wet food, some kind of liquid-based meal topper, or a squeezeable treat. I recommend Delectables stew packs or Tiki Cat squeezeable treats.
        </p>

        <p>
          Kitten-proof your home until they learn the rules. Kittens and new adopts are babies; they learn like we do, by making mistakes.
          <i>If you care about it, kitten-proof it.</i>
        </p>

        <p>
          Scratching posts: cats soothe themselves and mark their scent by scratching things. Teaching them young and early where scratching is allowed will keep your couches in pristine shape for longer.
        </p>

        <p>
          Brush your cat’s teeth with feline-friendly toothpaste. Brushing with human-grade toothpaste can make them seriously ill or worse —
          <i>it can be fatal.</i>
        </p>

        <p>
          Cut your indoor cat’s nails regularly. I aim for once a week to biweekly. If your cat’s nails get too long, they can curl into their paw pad, causing them serious pain and you an expensive vet bill.
        </p>

        <p>
          Catify your home! It absolutely does not need to happen all at once, but slowly add nice things that your cat loves to your space. For us in the beginning, I would buy little things biweekly to add to his collection. This will make adjusting to their new space much easier on them, thus easier on you, the human.
        </p>

        <p>
          Scent soakers — soft things like blankets and beds for them to knead into and make feel and smell like they are theirs.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are natural dewormers that can be added to food or water so you don’t have to traumatize them by “pilling” them. My cat hates pilling. The natural option is a wonderful backup and also much cheaper.
          <a target="_blank" href="https://a.co/d/4i0aM83"><i>Click here</i></a> for my personal recommendation for herbal deworming.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cats are obligate carnivores, and need to eat dry food that is at least 26–30 percent protein to guarantee healthy growth, development, and reproduction (if you are into breeding).

      <p class="HFI-P2">
        Completely abandoning your pet’s current diet isn't typically recommended to supplement things from this list. Cherry-picking certain things off this list, choosing only what helps ailments your fur child already has, is also recommended. If you choose to commit to meal-prepping your kitty’s food that is okay. However, as it is a huge commitment, there is another feasible and more pocket-friendly option:

          Pumpkin helps soothe stomach upset. Pumpkin purée with no additives, which you can find at your local grocery store, or pumpkin made specifically for cats, can be extremely helpful with digestive issues.
        </li>

        <li>
          Fish oil helps with coat, skin, and brain function for our feline friends.
        </li>

        <li>
          I personally believe in a well-rounded diet if it is financially feasible. Cats are carnivores, so that means a variety of meats and seafood.
        </li>

        <li>
          One-ingredient treats exist! Freeze-dried minnows can be found on Amazon in a plethora of choices.

        <li>
          Cosequin treats are basically a one-for-all option. They are one of the most highly praised treats for joint support by vets and fur pawrents near and far. My kitten is by no means an older cat, but he definitely jumps around with no issues.

        <li>
          Extra virgin coconut oil has antioxidant properties and helps in the absorption of other minerals. It can also be used for cats with dry skin or other skin and fur ailments.
        </li>

        <li>
          Coconut oil is about 40% lauric acid. The lauric acid found in coconut oil has been shown to be more effective in fighting staph bacteria than some antibiotics, as well as being preventative against certain cancers.
        </li>

        <li>
          Some herbs like chamomile or valerian root can be used for calming effects or to relieve stress.
        </li>

        <li>
          L-lysine helps support a cat's immune system and is often used to help manage feline herpes virus.
        </li>

        <li>
          Probiotics made for cats can be given to your feline friend to help support both digestive health and a happy gut.
        </li>

        <li>
          Taurine is an essential amino acid that has been proven to be crucial for your cat's heart and eye health.
        </li>

        <li>
          Cat grass and catnip can also be beneficial for digestion and mental stimulation.
        </li>

        <li>
          Brewer's yeast contains B vitamins, and may help repel fleas naturally.
        </li>

        <li>
          Milk thistle can help support and detoxify your kitty's liver.
        </li>

        <li>
          Chondroitin and glucosamine help support healthy joint function, particularly in older cats. These are both ingredients in Cosequin treats.
        </li>

        <li>
          Bone broth provides hydration and nutrients, which is especially helpful for sick or finicky eaters.
        </li>

        <li>
          It is possible to make bone broth and lickable treats with ingredients you may already have.
        </li>

        <li>
          Spirulina is a nutrient-rich algae that can be added to improve overall health.
          Blue spirulina is most commonly supplemented by pet parents.
        </li>

        <li>
          Although highly tempting, do not feed raw fish or sushi to cats. It can result in a deficiency, which is talked about in the “Can My Cat Eat That?” section in more detail if you are interested.

          Raw fish – raw fish contains enzymes that break down vitamin B1 in a cat's body, resulting in a deficiency. This deficiency can lead to neurological problems, seizures, locomotion disorders, and can be fatal for your cat.

          Grapes, currants, and raisins – grapes contain a compound that has yet to be identified, which affects the kidneys and can lead to sudden renal failure.
        </li>
        <li>
          Raw yeast dough – raw dough will rise while it is in the stomach of a cat. This can cause a lot of pain and
          <i>actually stretch their stomach.</i>
          As it sits, the dough ferments, which produces alcohol. This can result in alcohol poisoning.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dairy products – cats cannot process dairy products. Most cats lack, or only have small amounts of, the enzyme lactase, which gives the body the ability to process and break down lactose.
        </li>
        <li>
          Xylitol – xylitol is an artificial sweetener used in many human foods and other products, including chewing gum, sweets, nut butters, baked goods, diabetic foods, and toothpaste. If ingested, it can cause an abnormal increase in insulin release from the pancreas, which in turn leads to a dangerous decrease in overall blood sugar levels.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mushrooms – many mushrooms contain compounds that are toxic to cats. These toxins can affect multiple systems in their body and may even result in death.

          </a>
        </p>
        <li>
          I currently own this fountain and absolutely love it. It has a night light that helps the human see it in the dark, and helps the kitty find it while you sleep. Something I have to mention that I love about it: my kitten is a rough player and knocks into his fountain lots of times while playing. It has yet to spill because it was knocked due to rough play.

          A friend of mine owns this fountain, and has raved about how there are three different flow designs to choose from.

          I thought this one was interesting because of the ball flow design, while also being just 20 dollars.

          Although this one is app-controlled, it made priority on my wishlist because of the slow-feed feature that can dispense food over the course of ten minutes. Cats who eat too fast are susceptible to throwing up, even if they are eating high-quality food. Slow feeders, electronic or otherwise, are helpful for pet parents who are having issues with their feline friend eating too fast.
